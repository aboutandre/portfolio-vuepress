# Frogger-like Arcade Game

This is an arcade game just like the old-school Frogger.

To play the game just start the [index.html file](https://github.com/aboutandre/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game)

## How to play the game
The objective here is to cross from the grass to the water ('cause it's a hot day and you wanna stay fresh, right?).

But those nasty bugs are keeping you from the water!

Dodge those suckers using the arrow keys!

Once you reach the other side and fresh yourself up the game starts again. But now with even more bugs!

Show those [Coccinellidae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coccinellidae) who is the dodgier of them all and have some fun!
