# Portfolio

So... this project is this own site!

Don't you love how _meta_ this is?

The complete site is being built with [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/), most precisely [Vuepress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/). And it is being continuously deployed to [Netlify](http://netlify.com) via Github.

Check the complete project [here](https://github.com/aboutandre/portfolio-vuepress).
