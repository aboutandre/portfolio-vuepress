# News Feed Reader

In this project you can test a feed reader, also known as a news aggregator.

For this project I used the Jasmine JavaScript testing framework version 2.1.2.

Check the [spect file used in for testing](https://github.com/aboutandre/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader/blob/master/jasmine/spec/feedreader.js).
