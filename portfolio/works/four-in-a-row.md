# Four in a row game

This project showcases the use of Object Oriented JavaScript to create a
playground game called "Four in a row", in which the objective is to get
four tokens in a row, horizontally, vertically or diagonaly. As soon as
a player manages that she wins.

Five JavaScript classes have been created for this game: Board, Game, Player, Space and Token. This allows us to have a more modular approach to our objects.
